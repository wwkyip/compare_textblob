Compare two text blobs and calculate the similarity

Calculate similarity between two text blobs and plot the word cloud of most frequent words

Just for fun, I am using Ed Sheeran's Shape of You and Sam Chokri's Oh Why lyrics as samples to compare. Interestingly only 9% similarity in terms of unique words. Wonder why people are fighting in court when the dispute can be answered by a Python script.
