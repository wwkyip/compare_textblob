I need a god to feed my soul from this famine,
I do believe but i don’t understand it,
I lost my mind on the road to this freedom,
Cos my abyss is a life without reason,
Oh why, oh why, oh why oh
Why do i put my self through this,
Oh why, oh why, oh why oh
Why do i put my self through this,
Oh why, oh why, oh why oh I hope the sufferings worth it,
And we suffer for a purpose,
Money talks but prevents us to speak truth,
Paper chase, cut down trees that we breathe through,
Go to war for a greedy mans proﬁt,
Lose a son/sun as he clips and then he shoots,
An eclipse when he leaves you.
Oh why, oh why, oh why oh
Why do i put my self through this,
Oh why, oh why, oh why oh
Why do i put my self through this,
Oh why, oh why, oh why oh
I hope the sufferings worth it,
And we suffer for a purpose,
This is my soul to yours,
Sparking thoughts and moments in lifes eternal ﬂame,
I went to hell and back and externalized my internal pain,
Burnt by ego and what my life should be with no purpose gained,
I realized if I die this sphere will still spin,
The sun will still come up and you can still hear
This song which helped me clear some fear from within,
I realised how little I matter in
Existence and matter so stopped looking at myself,
And for the ﬁrst time I really looked at the world,
This unusual beautiful world,
This world which could be heaven but
Is more of a, working poorly purgatory,
Where children die for a war that started decades before their
ﬁrst breath, Yet they burn for someone else’s undeserving glory,
A world where fear feels mandatory and is forced
Down our throats by endless seeds of media lies,
Which blossom in peoples minds and distract the masses
From peace as if universal love and freedom is a secret, I,
Read an old Suﬁ story which touched me on a visceral level,
A man, who in a rage in a mess,
Haunted by the world and the pain and distress broke down,
He allowed the suffering in this world
To internalize into his own soul and mind,
And in a blinded crying rage,
He stepped out the street,
Looked up to the sky and raised,
His voice to the top of his lungs and screamed
“WHY GOD,
OH WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SUFFERING IN THIS LIFE GOD?”
He took to the ﬂoor began hitting the earth till his
Knuckles bled, Screaming with every troubled breath,
“WHY DON’T YOU DO SOMETHING? YOUR MEANT TO REPRESENT LOVING
AND BREATH,
NOT HUNGER AND DEATH, WHY DON’T YOU DO SOMETHING!?’
And after hours of transitioning the worlds ﬂaws in
This critical phase, Into his own literal, physical pain,
He exhausted asked silently once more,
“Why don’t you do something?
There’s so much pain and lies in
This world, why don’t you send truth?”
And in a peaceful fleeting moment
Which felt eternal god replied to him,
“I have done something, I sent you”
See the powers in your hands, The powers in my hands,
No amount of guns or greed,
Or lies or money can steal the eternal truth of universal love,
Which is at the core of all of our existence.
